### [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Packages Required (Install with [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)):
- [Discord](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
- [chat-exporter](https://pypi.org/project/chat-exporter/)

---
### Setup
- Place all bot related files into a seperate folder (this is **important** to do so, or else the python compiler will not be able to find the bot files necessary for the ticket bot to work)
- Create three categories in the discord server that the bot will be running in labeled: Active, OnHold, and Archived (set permissions as needed).
- Create a channel that the bot can use to send the "Create a ticket" embed.
- Create a bot application at the [discord developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and enable all intents. 
- Add the bot to your discord server by generating a OAuth2 invite link for your application and make sure to enable **bot** and **apps.commands**. Then for the permissions, tick Administrator.
- Copy your bot token from the [discord developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications) under the bot tab and add it to the "[token.json](https://github.com/WebTheDev/TicketBot/blob/main/token.json)" file.
- Adjust the "[config.py](https://github.com/WebTheDev/TicketBot/blob/main/config.py)" file to your liking.
- Run the "[main.py](https://github.com/WebTheDev/TicketBot/blob/main/main.py)" file in python and the bot should start up. The bot will be fully running once the "Bot is up and running" message is outputted to the console.
- Run the **/sync** command in order to sync the bot's slash commands with discord.
- **ON FIRST RUN, THE BOT WILL EXIT PYTHON AUTOMATICALLY IN ORDER TO SAVE THE MESSAGE ID OF THE "CREATE A TICKET" EMBED IN THE BOT'S CONFIG.** Simply restart the bot again in order to apply the necessary config changes.

### Support
- Please open up a issue to report any bugs with the TicketBot.

---
### Known Errors
- Interaction fail on unknown slash command. (There is no error handling in the API for this yet, therefore a interaction fail will occur on the users side and a compiler error will be outputted to the console)
- Viewing Transcribed Tickets in a Web Browser, discord has restricted the ability to view sent files in a channel in a web browser. I am currently working on a fix to resolve this issue.

- I would like to say a huge thanks to my good friend [Reb](https://rebsdesigns.com/). Without him, this whole idea of me making a "Ticket Bot" for discord would of never been possible. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make a bot for you in the first place, kickstarting my devving career.

- Thank you to my good friend [Jake](https://github.com/jfmcdavitt) who helped me setup some of the backend parts of the bot. Without him, I would still be pondering on how am I going to make some parts of this thing work.
